# FPGA Project

Welcome to the FPGA repository! This project contains all the designs, simulations, and documentation related to the FPGA work.
The project showcases an advanced FPGA design and implementation effort, with comprehensive documentation detailing the entire development process. The main document provides in-depth analyses, including system architecture, simulation results, and design methodologies, while the accompanying presentation offers a summarized overview of the project’s objectives, timeline, and key outcomes. Together, these documents illustrate the rigorous exploration of FPGA technologies, highlighting both the theoretical and practical aspects of the work, and demonstrating the successful integration of complex digital circuits and verification strategies.

## Overview

This repository includes:
- Source code and designs for FPGA development.
- Documentation detailing the project work, design implementations, and results.
- Supporting resources and examples that help you get started with FPGA projects.

## Documentation

Two PDF files are attached which provide detailed insights into the work completed:

- **main.pdf** – This document presents an in-depth overview, design details, and simulation results.
- **sumit_BTP_presentation.pdf** – This presentation gives a summarized view of the project's scope, objectives, methodologies, and outcomes.
